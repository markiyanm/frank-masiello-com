                    <p>How do you begin to wrap up 65 years of such a life well lived.</p>
                    <p>My dad would have loved all of us being here together for him, everyone he cared about. My dad was my favorite person. To know him was to love him. To meet him was to be his friend.</p>
                    <p>My dad grew up in Lynn, to a big exciting family, he was very proud of his upbringing with his beloved parents and many siblings. He often shared stories of breaking each other's bones, sledding off roofs, and tearing open his chin not once but three times doing the same silly thing. The fact that as a child, for his birthday he got $5 and used it to buy an entire bakery pizza and hid it in his closet to eat for days, pretty much sums it all up. He was a good alter boy turned wild haired "pig pen" who built motorcycles and met my mom at a very young age at Nahant Beach. They married 44 years ago on Aug 16th.</p>
                    <p>He move away from Lynn and started his family in a new town and how he loved so much. All while working at GE making countless friends in his proud 43 year career. My dad worked hard, while we were kids always planning our future, he was the ultimate planner in life and at work, and he had so many plans for his retirement, to travel to and to watch his grandchildren grow up...</p>
                    <p>Even though my dad worked hard to provide for us, he always made time to eat dinner with us every night, coach sports, teach us his boy scout knowledge and make us feel safe and loved our whole childhood. He taught me more things than I can even try to wrap my head around, I always joke that I cannot make a decision without my dad. I would have asked him to help me write this if I could.He was woven into every single facet of my life. There is not a memory, adventure, lesson, event that does not include him to this day.</p>
                    <p>He was more than a dad, he was my best friend who I saw and talked to every day. People keep saying I am so much like him and that makes me feel honored, but nobody looked at the world in such detail and wonderment as my dad. I wish I had a fraction of his imagination, thoughtfulness, and insight. He would have made the best old man, even as a barely legal senior citizen he was already using it as an excuse to get away with stuff.</p>
                    <p>The world and all of us lost a friend, my dad had "it". He had time for everyone, genuinely loved and cared for all of his friends and neighbors and was always making new ones. He was loyal, friendly, smart, sincere, and charming... just like his dad, so charming.</p>
                    <p>If anyone in his life needed a token dad, uncle or grandpa, he was more than willing to stop what he was doing and be there to help or love them or give some thoughtful advice.</p>
                    <p>He should have had more time with all of us. He was just getting started. My children, while they only knew my father for 3 and 6 years, he helped raise them. He saw them every day and was so proud to be teaching the, about the world and relationships. I truly think this world hasn't seen a grandpa more committed to his grand kids. He is their best friend.</p>
                    <p>My daughter was the twinkle in his eye, so sweet and caring.He understood her so well. He would explain her and the way she sees the world to me. My son, Jackson Francis, is just like him. Same nose, same wild hair, same personality, same quick temper... a one man party. I wish my dad got to relish in that for more years.</p>
                    <p> Though I feel cheated for my children that they only had a few years with him, I know his impact on them will last a lifetime, and I hope all of you can help me keep his magic alive for them. My dad was truly special and I wish we could have bottled what he had and kept it with us forever.</p>
                    <p>My dad truly lived life to the fullest, he crammed in more than a lifetime. And while his loss seems sudden and senseless, we should all try to live with such purpose.</p>
                    <p>Since the small things in life were important to him, I think he would want all of you to know he spent his final days at Nahant Beach playing in the waves and building sand castles, riding roller coasters and bumper cars, teaching Belle how to ride her bike and Jackson how to share. And the day before he left us, on a whim, he decided to take a ride on a sky ride chairlift alone. It was high above the amusement park, next to a beautiful lake. I like to think that up there alone he absorbed every bit of this beautiful world before he left it.</p>
                    <p>Dad, life will never be as happy or carefree without you here with us. I hope we all make you proud on the way we move on together.</p>
                    <p>Before walking me down this very aisle on my wedding day, he whispered to me "the first steps to the rest of your life".</p>
                    <p>Dad, we will take these next steps with you in our hearts. I love you forever.</p>
